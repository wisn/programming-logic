## Repository Detail

This repository exists solely for archiving my activity during the Programming Logic course.
I also hope that this repository will help you to understand more about Programming Logic before you dive in.
The official programming language used by this course is Prolog.
However, in this repository, I will use another logic programming language called Mercury as a comparison with Prolog.

## How to Use

You may runs the code on your machine but you could use [SWISH](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/) as well.

For each problem, I will provides the SWISH URL so you may interact with the code and do some queries by yourself.
Read the problem description and the example query.
Copy and paste the query into SWISH and take a look the result.

## Available Contents

Here is the available contents at the moment.
